# opensource-and-cloud-deployment

Two of my favourite subjects, open source and deployment to the cloud

## Notes

* Open source
    * What is it
    * Its not just about code
    * Why contribute to open source
    * Contributor tips
    * What are the benefits to a project maintainer
    * Maintainer tips
* Cloud
    * Setup pipeline and deploy hello world first
    * Feature branching (gitflow)
    * Commit strategy + Changelog generation
    * Merging strategies
    * Automation - automated testing (cypress), extra tools like static code analysis / mutation testing
    * CI (run all automation)
    * CD (each feature/epic branch gets it own environment, protect main branches (GitHub code owner file), delete feature/epic environments after PR is closed)
    * Serverless / Firebase much easier (cost model is very effective), AWS / GCP more infrastructure as code is required

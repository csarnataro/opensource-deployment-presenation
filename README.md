Two of my favourite subjects, open source and deployment pipeline.

<b>Open source</b> powers most of the internet, linux, python, angular, bootstrap etc. What powers open source? The community, YOU!
With all these great tools at our finger tips, how best do we manage them and deploy them. We will through <b>open source</b> and how best to manage your <b>pipepline</b>.

## Notes

* Open source
    * What is it
    * Its not just about code
    * Why contribute to open source
    * Contributor tips
    * What are the benefits to a project maintainer
    * Maintainer tips
* Cloud
    * Setup pipeline and deploy hello world first
    * Feature branching (gitflow)
    * Commit strategy + Changelog generation
    * Merging strategies
    * Automation - automated testing (cypress), extra tools like static code analysis / mutation testing
    * CI (run all automation)
    * CD (each feature/epic branch gets it own environment, protect main branches (GitHub code owner file), delete feature/epic environments after PR is closed)
    * Serverless / Firebase much easier (cost model is very effective), AWS / GCP more infrastructure as code is required
